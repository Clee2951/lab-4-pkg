# geometry-demo

This is a minimal Python package for working with simple geometric shapes. Right now, it includes support for squares and circles. Each shape has an `area()` method, and thereâ€™s also a utility function, `area_stats()`, that takes any number of shapes and returns a summary dictionary with total, mean, min, and max areas.

I built this for Lab 4 (Software Packaging & Testing Fundamentals), and the goal was to get hands-on experience with structuring a Python package, writing unit tests using pytest, and installing the package in editable mode.
